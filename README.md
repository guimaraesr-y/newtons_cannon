# Newton Cannon Simulator
This is a simple projectile orbit simulator, based on the Newton cannon.

---
* Use "wasd" keys to move the scene (I'm working on it).
* Use the SPACE key or the button on the screen to launch some cannonballs.
* Use the left and right arrow to increase or decrease the force.

**Have fun!**
